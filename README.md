XMLSpectrum=========================== for XPath 2.0, XSLT 2.0, XSD 1.1, XML----------------------------------------###WhyMany syntax-highlighters fail to accurately render XPath 2.0, whether it is standalone or embedded in XML, such as XSLT or XSD. Even XQuery syntax-highlighting solutions suffer from limitations imposed on generic syntax highlighter plugins.###WhatXMLSpectrum comprises a principal XSLT 2.0 stylesheet and supporting stylesheets  designed specially to convert XSLT 2.0, XSD 1.1, XML or XPath 2.0 source code to HTML with syntax highlighting. It performs the following roles:- Syntax highlighter- Code formatter- Code hyper-linker*Image of sample output rendered in browser:*![Screenshot](http://www.qutoric.com/xslt/xmlspectrum/images/xsl-light.png)Emphasis on accurate rendering of XPath 2.0 expressions, either within XSLT/XSD or standalone.By default,  *all* formatting is preserved exactly as-is - with trim and formatting options##Features### Syntax Highlighting:- Processes plain-text or XML-text (complete or otherwise)- Optionally processes xsl:include and xsl:import referenced XSLT- Uses standard XSLT 2.0 - no extensions required (tested on Saxon-HE)- Uses [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color light/dark color themes- Generates the required CSS file also - depending on theme specified- 2 interface stylesheet samples supplied:	- *highlight-file.xsl*		- Identifies XML coloring scheme from root namespace (for XML)		- Accepts either plain-text or XML files	- *highlight-inline.xsl*		- Highlights numerous incomplete code samples embedded in host XHTML file                      - Designed to be extended to support XMLspec- XPath Highlighting:	- Supports XPath Comments	- All whitespace formatting preserved	- No dependency on reserved keywords           - Standalone files supported - or embedded in XML- XML Highlighting	- For snippets, namespace-correctness not required           - Target namespace prefix can be inferred from 1st element	- Built-in XML parser (coded in XSLT) keeps all text, as-is	- CDATA preserved intact and highlighted- XSLT 2.0 Highlighting	- Scheme colors help separate instructions from expressions           - Literal Result Elements have different coloring	- XPath colored for AVTs or native XPath attributes	- All formatting preserved- XSD 1.1 Highlighting	- Element and Attribute definition elements highlighted	- XPath coloring for *test* attribute in *assert* element### Formatting:- Formatting including whitespace between attributes and within attribute contents preserved by default- XML content is shown exactly as in the source - including intact entity references and CDATA sections etc.- [Option] *Indent*	- Indents XML proportional to the nesting level (Same as standard formatters)	- Smart attribute formatting (advanced feature)		- Aligned vertically with indentation consistent with the host element		- Multi-line content vertically aligned with pre-existing indentation preserved- [Option] *Auto-Trim*	- Removes pre-existing indentation (normally combined with the indent option)### Cross-referencing: Recursively processes all XSLT modules from a top-level stylesheet- Creates top-level 'map' to all modules	- Global members listed for each module	- Map entries hyperlinked to the code definitions	- Module entries hyperlinked to syntax-highlighted file	- Global members sorted alphabetically by name- Adds hyperlinks in code for:	- *xsl:include* and *xsl:import* hrefs	- Global Parameters	- Global Variables	- Standard Functions	- User-defined Functions	- Named Templates##Online Implementations[Syntax highlighter web app](http://highlight.myxsl.net/) by [Max Toro](https://github.com/maxtoroq)##Web Samples[demo output of Docbook XSLT 2.0 Project](http://qutoric.com/samples/docbook20demo/)[XMLSpectrum (highlight-file.xsl entry-file) run on itself](http://qutoric.com/samples/xmlspectrum-code/)[Transformed web page with embedded code samples](http://qutoric.com/samples/inline/highlighted-inline.html)### Included XSLT solutionsThe xmlspectrum.xsl stylesheet is intended for use by other stylesheets that import this and exploit its main functions: `render`, `showXPath` and `indent`:- *highlight-inline.xsl* - transforms XHTML file containing descriptive text and XSLT, XSD or XPath code examples-  *highlight-file.xsl*     - transforms files containing only XSLT,XSD or XPath*The dark theme:*![Screenshot](http://www.qutoric.com/xslt/xmlspectrum/images/xsd-dark.png)	##UsageFor usage instructions, see [xmlspectrum/app/xsl/readme](xmlspectrum/blob/master/app/xsl/readme.md)
